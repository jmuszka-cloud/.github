# j-cloud

## Purpose

Open-source software is king. Nothing beats the security, reliability, and freedom that comes with the "Free and Open-Source Software" (FOSS) philosophy. As a FOSS enthusiast, I have been gradually ending my reliance on proprietary software from big tech companies, and switching to open-source alternatives: Linux (PopOS, Manjaro, Fedora), GrapheneOS, self-hosted email server. Instead of being subject to the invasive telemetry and information-harvesting of Google and Microsoft products, I am in control of my own user-data. Instead of paying for bloated "software as a service" programs like Microsoft Office, I can save my hard-earned money and use superior software for free. Instead of trusting proprietary tech companies to create secure and efficient software, communities of passionate developers come together to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities. With the power of publicly-availiable source code, anything is possible.

As a passionate (and amateur) developer and tech enthusiast, my programming skills and FOSS philosophy go hand-in-hand. With j-cloud, my goal is to end my reliance on proprietary software, while also learning valuable development and programming skills. Over the next several months, I plan on launching and hosting my own custom (need I say open-source) software for many daily tasks that I rely on Google services for.

## Roadmap

This will be a long and difficult journey, but the end goal of having self-hosted, compartmentalized software will be invaluable to both my day-to-day life, and my development career. Each service will be built from the ground up to ensure maximum quality and security. For most of these projects, there will be three components: a server backend, running on my server-computer; a web-interface, to use in a browser from anywhere; and an Android app. The cloud-based infrastructure will allow for seamless use across devices and locations. With each project being independent, this will provide opportunity for me to experiment with many varying technologies, languages, and frameworks; all for the optimal learning experience. These projects are primarily for my personal use. However, good programming practices and well-built infrastructure will be deployed to allow other users to enjoy my software as well, sometime in the future.

## Future

The projects listed above will be completed and maintained indefinitely, but there is always room to develop more. Possible projects for the future include:

#### j-text
#### j-maps
#### j-phone

As previously mentioned, multi-user support will likely be added later down the line; though I'm not sure whether to implement it by invite-only, paid service, or completely open to the public. Additionally, I could also deploy these apps to Linux desktop, iOS, and other platforms. However, web and Android apps suffice for my own personal use.
